about 2 years ago we were sitting in my leaving room and one of my friends had an interesting idea:

**"how cool would it be if we had custom t-shirts of a cow that's getting high on a rooftop?!"**

this was right when stable diffusion and dall-e where getting more popular. I remember creating some really random designs for the three of us... we definitely annoyed the neighbours with how much we were laughing.

that's the night when one of our most fun projects started: Artefice (initially known as Dream)

the goal was to create custom pieces of clothing with AI. so, over the next 3 months I built [artefice.ai](http://artefice.ai) and we went through manufacturers, designed boxes for shipping, hand wrote notes, and tried to market the platform.

after selling (& personally delivering) ~75 t-shirts, we finally decided to stop. Artefice wasn't really a technical problem. the real challenge came from optimizing manufacturing and distribution.

this week I was going through my old git repos and remembered all the memories that came from this experience.

I felt kinda sad knowing how Artefice had basically died. however, my partner had a really good suggestion:

"why don't you open source it?"

she was right... why not?! so, without further ado, here's Artefice: [github.com/parsatajik/stealth-dream](https://github.com/parsatajik/stealth-dream)

the code is a bit old but I hope that it can help someone out there :)
