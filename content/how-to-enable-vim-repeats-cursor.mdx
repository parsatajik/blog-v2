This is a really quick one. I just got a new macbook and was going through its setup process.

I realized that the instructions provided on the [VSCodeVim github](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim?tab=readme-ov-file#mac) didn't really work.

This command did it for me: `defaults write -app Cursor ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false`
